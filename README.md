<h1>Birthday Wish </h1>

 Hello! Today is my Little sister's Birthday that's why I thinked to do something strange ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š As I am a programmer so I wanted to create somthing related my programming knowledge. So then I try to create that plan where I have used--
<br/>
<br/>
      <h3> 1. HTML <br/>
       2. CSS <br/>
       3. Javascript <br/>
       4. DOM <br/>
       5. ES6 <br/> </h3>
 <br/><br/>
 That was very interesting where my little sister click on Surprise button then she can see her image with background animation as well as her image also and a background Happy Birthday music also.
 That's it. 
 I share some screenshot from the live site ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
 
 <h3>This is main button which is Surprise Button</h3>

 <h3>After Click Button then that's animation will be visiualized</h3> <br/>
