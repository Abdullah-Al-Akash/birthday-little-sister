<h1>Birthday Wish <h1/>

<h3> Hello! Today is my Little sister's Birthday that's why I thinked to do something strange ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š As I am a programmer so I wanted to create somthing related my programming knowledge. So then I try to create that plan where I have used--
<br/>
<br/>
       1. HTML <br/>
       2. CSS <br/>
       3. Javascript <br/>
       4. DOM <br/>
       5. ES6 <br/>
 <br/><br/>
 That was very interesting where my little sister click on Surprise button then she can see her image with background animation as well as her image also and a background Happy Birthday music also.
 That's it.
